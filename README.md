## Overview

As well as the requirements listed in the challenge, I also added an error modal, wrote unit and integration tests using Vitest and React Testing Library, and
manually tested the app for accessibility using keyboard only navigation and
screen reader to ensuring all interactive elements are usable and correctly
announced.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Generate a password based on the selected inclusion options
- Copy the generated password to the computer's clipboard
- See a strength rating for their generated password
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
